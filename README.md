Welcome to my Trivia Game

This Trivia game is using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

* The game will display only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, the screen will congratulate them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds the next question will appear without player input.

* For wrong answers and time-outs:

  * If the player runs out of time, "TIME IS UP!" and the correct answer will be displayed. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question will appear.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, "Incorrect :(" and the correct answer will be displayed . Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* At the end of the game the score screen will show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and a "Play Again!" button.
